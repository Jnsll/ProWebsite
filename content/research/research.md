## Doctorate

I'm currently a PhD Student in Software Engineering and Hydrogeology at the University of Rennes 1. My doctorate is part of a collaboration between the IRISA and OSUR laboratories and reflects the desire to bring software engineering closer to the scientific field of hydrogeology. Thus, I participate in the research activities of the [DiverSE](https://www.diverse-team.fr/) and [DIMENV@risce](https://geosciences.univ-rennes1.fr/dynamique-imagerie-et-modelisation-des-systemes-environnementaux-dimenvrisce) teams.

My research work mainly focuses on modelling for decision making and flood risk assessment. I am applying approximate computing techniques to scientific models in order to make the exploration of simulation and prediction results interactive.
In my journey to achieve that goal, I am receiving valuable advice from my supervisors [Johann Bourcier](https://sites.google.com/site/johannbourcier/), [Jean-Raynald de Dreuzy](https://geosciences.univ-rennes1.fr/interlocuteurs/jean-raynald-de-dreuzy) and [Benoit Combemale](https://www.irit.fr/~Benoit.Combemale/).
